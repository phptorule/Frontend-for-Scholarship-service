          <p>
            These Terms of Use contains the terms and conditions that govern your
            access to and use of the Services (as defined below) to be provided to
            you by Apply Me Inc., d/b/a Sunrising.io (“Sunrise”) and is an agreement
            between Sunrise and you (“Customer”). These Terms of Use take effect when
            Customer clicks or checks the applicable button or box associated with these
            Terms of Use or, if earlier, when Customer uses any of the Services (“<b>Effective Date</b>”).
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>
              Sunrise may update these Terms of Use from time to time and will notify
              Customer of such updates either via email, sms or by posting notice of such
              changes on its website, or other reasonable means. Customer’s continued use of the
              Services after Sunrise’s provision of a notice of an updated version of these Terms of
              Use shall constitute Customer’s consent to such updated Terms of Use.
            </b>
          </p>

          <p><b>1.  Terms of Service.</b></p>

          <p class="underline">1.1. Access and Use of Services</p>

          <p>
            Customer may access and use the scholarship website management technology
            and services offered by Sunrise on its web site at
            <a class="red-link" target="_blank" href="https://sunrising.io/">sunrising.io</a> (“<b>Website</b>”)
            to which Customer has subscribed or agreed to accept (“<b>Services”</b>), in accordance
            with these Terms of Use. The Website is exclusively the property of Sunrise. The
            Services shall be integrated with the services provided by Apply Me Inc., d/b/a Scholarship
            Owl and Sunrising.io ("<b>Scholarship Owl</b>") on their website
            <a class="red-link" target="_blank" href="https://scholarshipowl.com/">ScholarshipOwl.com.</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            As part of the provision of the Services, Customers may administer
            their respective websites ("<b>Customer Website</b>") and any content uploaded
            and/or added to the Customer Website by Customer (“<b>Customer Content</b>”).
            Customers are solely responsible for their Customer Content. Sunrise does
            not review or monitor content posted by Customers and is not responsible for
            actions arising from Customer Content.
          </p>

          <p>
            Without limiting the foregoing, the permission granted to Customer
            to access and use the Services is based on Customer’s agreement to not
            access or use the Services for: (i) developing a product or service that
            could reasonably be regarded as being competitive with the Services, or (ii)
            monitoring the availability, performance or functionality of the Services, or
            for any other benchmarking or competitive purpose.
          </p>

          <p>
            1.2. <span class="underline">Additional Services.</span>
            Sunrise may from time to time offer additional services (“<b>Additional Services</b>”).
            If Customer chooses to accept or purchase Additional Services, Customer may be required to
            enter into a specific agreement for such Additional Services (“<b>Additional Agreement</b>”),
            provided that the terms of these Terms of Use will continue to apply to such Addition
            Services unless specifically amended by or conflicting with the terms of such Additional
            Agreement. Unless otherwise provided, the term “Services” shall include also all of the Additional Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            1.3. <span class="underline">Customer Account.</span>
            To access the Services, Customer must create an account associated with a
            valid email address (“<b>Account</b>”). Customer is solely responsible for
            Customer’s Account, including for: (i) controlling the access to,
            and use and security of, the Account and Account Content (as defined below),
            (ii) maintaining the security of the passwords and other measures used
            to protect access to the Account, and (iii) all instructions provided
            to Sunrise through the Account, whether or not authorized by Customer.
            Sunrise is not responsible for unauthorized access to the Account. Customer
            will contact Sunrise immediately if Customer believes an unauthorized third party
            may be using the Account. Nothing in the foregoing requires Sunrise to monitor the
            Account for unauthorized access or any other security breach.
          </p>

          <p>
            “<b>Account Content</b>” shall mean any information Customer has provided or
            has been collected in connection with establishing the Account or using the Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            1.4. <span class="underline">Separate Services; Disclaimer</span>
            Sunrise may from time to time make available to Customer, either through
            the Services or through a separate correspondence to Customer, third party
            services or offers that are not included as part of the Services (“<b>Separate Services</b>”).
            Customer hereby provides its affirmative consent to receive offers for Separate Services
            through email or sms, such consent which may be withdrawn at any time at Customer’s discretion
            by sending an email to
            <a class="red-link" href="mailto:unsubscribe@sunrising.io">unsubscribe@sunrising.io</a>.
            Customer hereby agrees to review, all terms
            of service and other agreements related to all Separate Services. Customer shall be solely
            responsible for strict compliance with any such terms of service or other agreements and from any
            liability arising from Customer’s use of the Separate Services. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE
            CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS OF USE, SUNRISE MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SEPARATE
            SERVICES AND SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE SEPARATE SERVICES, INCLUDING
            WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF ANY MISREPRESENTATIONS OR VIOLATIONS OF LAW, AND AS
            BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND SUNRISE, SEPARATE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
          </p>

          <p>
            1.5. <span class="underline">Third Party Services.</span>
            Certain components of the Services may be comprised of third party services,
            including by Scholarship Owl (“<b>Third Party Services</b>”), and Sunrise may perform
            its obligations hereunder through the third party providers of such Third Party
            Services (“<b>Third Party Service Providers</b>”). Without derogating from the limitation
            of liability and disclaimer of warranty provisions of these Terms of Use, Sunrise shall
            be responsible to Customer for Third Party Services to no greater extent than the same
            extent as such Third Party Service Providers are liable to Sunrise for provision of the
            Third Party Services. Sunrise may at any time, in its sole discretion, replace its Third
            Party Service Providers.
          </p>

          <p>
            1.6. <span class="underline">Services Changes.</span>
            Sunrise may modify, suspend or discontinue any of the Services
            or change or remove features or functionality of the Services or
            prices applicable thereto from time to time, without any liability to
            Customer. Sunrise will not be liable to Customer or to any third party
            for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services. Sunrise
            will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer of any material change
            to or discontinuation of the Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            1.7. <span class="underline">Suspension of Services.</span>
            At any time Sunrise may suspend the provision of Services and remove any Account
            Content and/or Customer Content  transmitted via the Services without liability: (i)
            if Sunrise reasonably believes that any Service is being used in violation of these
            Terms of Use or applicable law, (ii) if Sunrise reasonably believes that the use of the
            Services may pose a security risk to Sunrise or any third party, (iii) if ordered by a law
            enforcement or government agency or otherwise in order to comply with applicable law, (iv) if
            necessary for operation, maintenance or expansion of Sunrise’s Services, or for other technological
            purposes, (v) if required or requested by a Third Party Service Provider or if the Third Party Service
            is suspended or ceases to be provided for any reason (whether generally or through Sunrise), or (vi) if
            Customer fails to fulfill payment obligations. To the extent practicable, Sunrise shall use commercially
            reasonable efforts to notify Customer prior to suspending Services, except that no notice is required prior
            to suspension due to not fulfilling payment obligations. Account information may be unavailable to Customer
            during a suspension of Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            1.8. <span class="underline">Privacy Policy; Site Terms.</span>
            Customer consents to the collection, use and disclosure of information
            associated with Customer and Customer's use of the Website and the Services
            in accordance with these Terms of Use, and the Sunrise Privacy Policy; all as
            may be updated from time to time.
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>2. <b>Fees &amp; Billing.</b></p>

          <p>
            2.1. <span class="underline">Fees.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            In consideration for Customer’s usage of the Services, Customer agrees to pay
            Sunrise fees at Sunrise’s then-current pricing for the Services as published from
            time to time on the Website. All payments from Customer to Sunrise must be in United States Dollars.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sunrise may in its sole discretion modify its pricing upon the provision of at least 21 days’
            notice to already-paying customers, by posting on the Website and/or sending an email or sms
            to the address maintained for the relevant Account.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unless Customer notifies Sunrise in writing of Customer’s termination of its use of the Services
            within 14 days after delivery of such notice, the updated pricing shall apply to Customer’s access
            to and use of the Services
          </p>

          <p>
            2.2. <span class="underline">Billing.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            Sunrise will bill Customer for the Services ordered by Customer, through Customer's ’s credit card /
            debit card / PayPal account / Customer's designated bank account or ACH, either as a one-time payment,
            or in automatically reoccurring payments if Customer has an ongoing subscription. Sunrise shall send a
            sales receipt to Customer upon request.
          </p>

          <p>
            Customers with ongoing subscriptions are responsible for maintaining current and complete credit card /
            debit card / PayPal account on file with Sunrise at all times. Changes to this information must be
            communicated to Sunrise at <a class="red-link" href="mailto:contact@sunrising.io">contact@sunrising.io.</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            All charges are automatically made on Customer’s specific billing cycle date.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sunrise shall have the right to suspend Customer’s Account without prior notice once payment
            is overdue by 10 calendar days.
          </p>

          <p>
            TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CUSTOMER WAIVES ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO CHARGES ASSOCIATED
            WITH THE SERVICES UNLESS CLAIMED WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER THE CHARGE.
          </p>

          <p>
            All payments are non-refundable and will not be prorated at any time.
          </p>

          <p>
            2.3. <span class="underline">Late Fees.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            Sunrise may charge interest on overdue amounts at the lesser of 1.5% per month
            and the maximum rate permitted by law, plus all reasonable expenses and costs of
            collection (including collection agency fees, attorney fees and court costs). The
            assessment of interest shall not limit Sunrise’s other rights and remedies for late
            payment, including Sunrise’s right to suspend or terminate access to the Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            2.4. <span class="underline">Taxes.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            Customer is responsible for all taxes, fees and duties, including penalties and interest, imposed
            in connection with these Terms of Use (“<b>Taxes</b>”). Customer will pay Sunrise its fees without
            reduction for Taxes. If Sunrise is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes
            will be invoiced to Customer, unless Customer provides Sunrise on a timely basis with
            a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority
            (along with any supporting documentation that Sunrise may require in connection with such
            tax exemption certificate). If any deduction or withholding is required by law, Customer will
            notify Sunrise and pay Sunrise any additional amounts necessary to ensure that the net amount that
            Sunrise receives, after any deduction and withholding, equals the amount Sunrise would have received
            if no deduction or withholding has been required. Customer shall provide to Sunrise original or certified
            copies of all Tax payments or other evidence of payment of Taxes by Customer with respect to transactions
            or payments under these Terms of Use.
          </p>

          <p>
            2.5. <span class="underline">Third Party Fees.</span>
            Any third-party fees (including credit card, debit card, PayPal and bank fees)
            (“<b>Third Party Fees</b>”) are Customer’s sole responsibility, and if charged to Sunrise,
            Customer shall pay Sunrise an additional amount equaling the Third Party Fees in order
            to ensure that the net amount that Sunrise receives equals the amount Sunrise would have
            received if no Third Party Fees had been charged.
          </p>

          <p>
            3. <b>Term and Termination.</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            3.1. <span class="underline">Term.</span>
            These Terms of Use will commence on the Effective Date and will remain in effect until terminated
            by either party in accordance with the terms hereof. Customer is encouraged to keep records of all
            communications regarding termination.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.2. <span class="underline">Termination for Convenience</span>
            Each party may terminate these Terms of Use and Customer’s right to access and use the Services
            by providing the other party with 7 business days prior notice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Customer’s mere cancelation of its credit card / debit card / PayPal account associated
            with its Account does not terminate these Terms of Use or Customer’s obligation to pay for
            the Services. In such case, Sunrise will continue to the Account as active and the billing cycle
            will continue, resulting in a past due account that may be turned over to a third party collection
            service. Customer must terminate these Terms of Use and Customer’s right to access and use the Services
            by notifying Sunrise through the Account or by telephone.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.3. <span class="underline">Termination for Breach and Other Reasons.</span>
            Sunrise may terminate these Terms of Use and Customer’s right to access and use the Services
            immediately and without liability upon providing notice to Customer as follows: (i) if Sunrise
            reasonably suspects a breach of these Terms of Use or violation of applicable law, (ii) if Sunrise
            is threatened with a legal claim, including for intellectual property infringement, related to the
            Services, (iii) if Customer’s act or omission results in a suspension described in Section 1.8, (iv)
            if Sunrise’s relationship with a Third Party Services Provider expires, terminates or requires Sunrise
            to change the Services or terminate these Terms of Use, (v) if Sunrise believes providing the Services
            could create an economic or technical burden or security risk, (vi) in order to comply with applicable law
            or requests of governmental entities, or (vii) if Sunrise determines that the use of the
            Services by Customer or Sunrise’s provision of any of the Services has become impractical or
            unfeasible for any legal or regulatory reason.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.4. <span class="underline">Effect of Termination.</span>
            If these Terms of Use is terminated, then: (i) Sunrise shall immediately terminate
            Customer’s access to the Services, (ii) all fees and Taxes that Customer is obliged to
            pay Sunrise, up to the effective date of termination, will be charged at the end of the
            then-current billing period, (iii) there will be no refund of any amount already paid by
            Customer as of the effective date of termination, including any amount in respect of the
            period following the effective date of termination, and (iv) Sunrise shall maintain Account Content.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.5. If these Terms of Use are terminated (whether at Customer's request or at Sunrise’s discretion),
            it may cause or result in the loss of certain content, features, or capacity of the Customer Website,
            including any Customer Content, End User data or other usage data retained therein, and including
            any domain name reservation or registration that was included in such Services (“<b>Capacity Loss</b>”).
            Sunrise shall not be liable in any way for such Capacity Loss, or for saving a backup of Customer
            Content or End User data. Additional Fees may apply to re-activation of an Account and/or any Services
            following their cancellation, as determined by Sunrise in its sole discretion.
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>4 <b>Acceptable Use.</b></p>

          <p>
            4.1. Customer shall use the Services in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances,
            rules and regulations, shall not violate or attempt to violate Sunrise’s system or network security,
            and shall not misuse the Services in any way. Customer shall not and shall not permit third parties to
            (i) engage in, solicit, or promote any activity that is illegal, invasive, violates the rights of
            others, or could subject Sunrise to liability to third parties, (ii) import, upload, copy, use or
            publish Customer Content that is defamatory, misleading, fraudulent, obscene, distasteful,
            harassing, discriminatory, racially or ethnically offensive, contains sexually suggestive
            or explicit content, facilitates or promotes illegal activity, or contains illegal
            content, (iii) distribute viruses, worms, Trojan horses, corrupted files, hoaxes, or
            other items of a disabling, destructive, damaging, or deceptive nature, (iv) use any of the
            Services in connection with any form of spam, unsolicited mail, fraud, scam, phishing, “chain
            letters”, “pyramid schemes” or similar conduct, or otherwise engage in unethical marketing
            or advertising, (v) offer, promote or sell any scholarships, products or services, or provide
            any information, content or materials regarding scholarships, services or products, which may be
            deemed fraudulent or with no intention and/or ability to provide any such scholarships, services
            or products, as applicable, (vi) block, mask or obscure advertisements that appear on the Website
            without Sunrise's prior written approval, or (vii) disable, interfere with, or circumvent any aspect
            of the Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.2. It is clarified that Sunrise does not monitor in any way Customer Content, and it is Customer’s
            sole responsibility to monitor the content imported, uploaded, copied, used or published by Customer
            or on Customer's behalf, pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4. In the event there
            is concern regarding any violation of these Terms of Use by Customer, Sunrise is authorized,
            in its sole discretion, to monitor Customer’s compliance, to immediately terminate or suspend
            the provision of Services to Customer, or to block the transmission of Customer Content which in
            Sunrise’s opinion violates any application law or otherwise may impose any liability on Sunrise.
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>5. <b>Publicity.</b></p>

          <p>
            Customer hereby irrevocably and in perpetuity grant to Sunrise and those acting under Sunrise’s
            authority the unrestricted, absolute, perpetual, worldwide right and license to use Customer’s
            name, trademarks, address, photograph, information, statements, and Customer Content
            (collectively, “<b>Promotional Content</b>”), all in connection with marketing purposes; and
            to reproduce, copy, modify, create derivative works of, display, perform, exhibit, distribute,
